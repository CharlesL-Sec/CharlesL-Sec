# Charles London  
## Technical security team (SeOps/ServiceNow SME)  

I am interested in technical security operations, incident response automation, and adversarial techniques.  
I have over 20 years of experience in IT security and have recently returned to code after learning C in 1988.  
I have a long career in IT security in food manufacturing, banking and local authorities.
I am interested in next-generation tools and using bespoke solutions for automation and rapid response.  

### Today, I am working on the following:
- ServiceNow workflow design  
- Splunk courses 
- Python scanning scripts   
- IT security incident repsonse improvements using existing tooling and systems.

### Learning
